# 📌 Image Visualization using NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on importing, processing, and visualizing images using Python. The process involves converting images into arrays and graph formats, enabling manipulation and transformation of the image's properties, such as color adjustment and resizing.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: This handles image data as arrays and performs mathematical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing images in graph and array forms.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image processing, including resizing, color adjustments, and more.

## 🌍 Applications
- Image classification and preprocessing for AI models
- Data visualization in machine learning
- Basic image editing and transformation
